# 🍽️ Restaurant Experience Dashboard

## 📌 Overview

An interactive single-page restaurant frontend that showcases a modern dining brand. It blends a responsive layout, light/dark theming, animated section reveals, and deep‑linkable menu and specials pages to give visitors a quick tour of offerings before they book or order.
